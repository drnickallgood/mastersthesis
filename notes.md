- qrack's example loads a lookup table and then creates a statevector for the output
	- Loads it into the registers.. i think

- It uses some lower level functions that ADD and SUB to the accumulator for the registers
- Does it need half reg for control and half for data?  -- I don't think so..
- question is, how can i load a lookup table in qiskit?
